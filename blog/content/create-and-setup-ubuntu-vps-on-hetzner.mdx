This guide will walk you through **creating a VPS on Hetzner Cloud**, installing Ubuntu Desktop, setting up **NoMachine** for GUI access, and configuring a firewall.

---

## 1. Create a VPS on Hetzner

1. Go to [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud).
2. Create a new project (if you donâ€™t have one yet).
3. Click **Add Server**.
4. Choose the following options:
   - **Location:** Closest to your users (e.g., Germany, Finland, US).
   - **Image:** Ubuntu (latest LTS recommended).
   - **Architecture:** **x86 (Intel/AMD)** â†’ better compatibility than ARM64.
   - **Type:** CX21 or higher (2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM is a good start).
   - **Volume:** At least 40 GB SSD.
5. Add your **SSH key** or generate one if you donâ€™t have it.
6. Click **Create & Buy Now**.

Once created, Hetzner will provide you with an IP address.

## 2. Connect to Your VPS via SSH

From your local terminal:

```bash
ssh root@<your-server-ip>
```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with the IP shown in Hetznerâ€™s dashboard.
here is an example

```bash
ssh root@123.456.789.123
```

---

## 3. Update & Install Ubuntu Desktop

Update packages and install a desktop environment:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y
sudo apt-get install iptables -y
sudo apt install net-tools -y
```

---

## 4. Create a New User

Instead of using `root`, create a safe non-root user:

```bash
adduser jervi
adduser jervi sudo
usermod -aG sudo jervi
```

---

## 5. Install NoMachine (for GUI Access)

NoMachine lets you access your VPS with a desktop interface.

### Step 1: Download package
```bash
wget https://download.nomachine.com/download/8.9/Linux/nomachine_8.9.1_1_amd64.deb
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install libpng16-16 libjack-jackd2-0 -y
```

### Step 3: Install NoMachine
```bash
sudo dpkg -i nomachine_8.9.1_1_amd64.deb
```

### Step 4: Start NoMachine service
```bash
/usr/NX/bin/nxserver --status
/usr/NX/bin/nxserver --start
/usr/NX/bin/nxserver --startup
```

Now you can connect from your computer using the **NoMachine client** and the VPS IP address.

## 6. Secure the Server with Firewall (UFW)

Enable UFW and allow essential ports:

```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 4000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp   # Web
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp  # HTTPS
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # SSH (to be safe)
sudo ufw reload
```

Note that you are obliged to allow ssh and port 22 even if it is the same
also if you have changed the ssh port, then allow it too

## âœ… Your Hetzner VPS is Ready!

- Ubuntu Desktop is installed.  
- A safe user (`jervi`) is created.  
- NoMachine GUI access is available.  
- Firewall is protecting your VPS.  

ðŸ‘‰ Next step: you can start installing your preferred software, development stack, or deploy apps.

## How to connect to this new VPS user via SSH

```bash
ssh jervi@<your-server-ip>
```

```tsx
ðŸŽ‰ Your Ubuntu VPS on Hetzner is ready!
```
